config BAMBINO_HIGHPRI

        default n
        depends on ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT
        ---help---
                This selection enables building of the custom test for the Cortex-M
                high priority, nested interrupts.  ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT must first
                be enabled.  This test is only implemented on the STM32F103VCT6
                (ARCH_CHIP_STM32F103VC) but should be easily ported to other STM32
                architectures.

if BAMBINO_HIGHPRI

config BAMBINO_TMR0_FREQUENCY
        int "TIM6 Frequency"
        default 1000000
        ---help---
                TMR0 is used to drive the high priority, nested interrupt in the
                test enabled with BAMBINO_HIGHPRI.  This setting specifies the
                frequency of the TMR0 input clock.

config BAMBINO_TMR0_PERIOD
        int "TIM6 Period"
        default 1000000
        ---help---
                TMR0 is used to drive the high priority, nested interrupt in the
                test enabled with BAMBINO_HIGHPRI.  This setting specifies
                period of the TMR0 interrupt in units of BAMBINO_TMR0_FREQUENCY.
